# 📁 dex — Directory Explorer in C

`dex` is a lightweight and fast command-line tool written in C to recursively display a directory tree. It supports sorting, filtering, and dotfile visibility — ideal for terminal users who want a simple and scriptable file-tree viewer.

---

## 🔧 Installation

### 🔨 Build and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dex.git
cd dex
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
````

* Installs the `dex` binary to `/usr/local/bin/dex` by default.

### 🗑 Uninstallation

```bash
make -C build uninstall
```

* Removes the binary from your system.

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
dex [options] <directory>
```

* If `<directory>` is omitted, dex defaults to the current directory (`.`).
* Flags can appear in any order.
* You may use `-p <dir>` or `--path <dir>` to explicitly specify the path.

## ⚙️ Options

| Option                     | Description                                                              |

| `-d`, `--show-dotfiles`    | Include dotfiles (files starting with `.`) in the output.                |
| `--sort=alpha`             | Sort entries alphabetically (default).                                   |
| `--sort=size`              | Sort directories by total size recursively.                              |
| `--ignore <name> [...]`    | Ignore one or more files or directories by name. Supports multiple args. |
| `-p <dir>`, `--path <dir>` | Explicitly specify the directory path to explore.                        |

> Note: If both `--ignore` and a path are provided, the last non-option argument is treated as the path.
